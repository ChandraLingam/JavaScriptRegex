# JavaScriptRegex
Hi, and welcome to the JavaScript Regular Expressions Course!  

In just a couple of hours, you will gain precise and relevant information that you can immediately apply to your projects  

I am Chandra Lingam, and I am your instructor.  

Course Lectures are available on following Learning Platforms:

Here are some typical uses of regular expression  

1. You can implement a client-side check for input validation. For example, your app can guide the user to provide data in the correct format.  

2. As part of the zero-trust architecture, you need to validate input to your microservice. With JavaScript regex, you can verify and validate data payloads in your node js application  

3. Regex also provides powerful text processing capabilities   

### Let’s look at what you will learn in this course

### Course outline
* In the JavaScript Regex features section, you will get familiar with various regex methods, their purpose, and how to unit test your pattern  
* In the regex language section, you will learn how to write patterns – starting from the simplest of patterns  
* You will also learn to incorporate regex in your HTML input types for validation  
* Regex engine puts the onus on the developers, that is us, to write efficient patterns - you will gain knowledge of regular expression engine that will help you write optimal patterns  
* There are several exercises for you to apply your new skills  
* We then look at performance and how poorly written patterns can degrade exponentially - You will learn how to optimize the patterns and address performance issues  
* There are three hands-on projects in this course - You will learn how to apply the regex for three distinctly different data sets – unstructured log data, IoT sensor data, and parsing medical test data in HTML format  

### Source Code
The source code for this course is distributed using Github – so, you always have access to up-to-date code  

As part of resources, you will get this high-quality cheat-sheet for regex language and an interactive regex tool to write and test patterns  

You will get prompt support through the course Q&A forum and private messaging.  

I am looking forward to meeting you  

Thank You!
